 *The proposed IE-KD framework.
 The student network is split into two parts. One part (colored in orange) inherits the compact
 and effective representations encoded by factors from the teacher network via
 consistency/inheritance loss (similarity), and the other part (colored in
 blue) is pushed to generate different features via diversity/exploration loss
 (dis-similarity). The supervised task (classification/detection) loss guides
 the exploration part to converge to diverse yet effective features.*

 **Code coming soon!**
